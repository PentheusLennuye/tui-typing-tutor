In general, you will find no art or faculty that can analyze itself, therefore none that can approve or disapprove of itself. The art of grammar is restricted to analyzing and commenting on literature. Music is confined to the analysis of harmony. Consequently neither of them analyzes itself. Now, if you are writing to a friend, the art of grammar will help you decide what words to use; but it will not tell you whether it is a good idea to write to your friend in the first place. Music is no different; whether this is a good time to sing and play, or a bad one, the art of music by itself cannot decide.
	So what can? The faculty that analyzes itself as well as the others, namely, the faculty of reason. Reason is unique among the faculties assigned to us in being able to evaluate itself – what it is, what it is capable of, how valuable it is – in addition to passing judgement on others.
	What decides whether a sum of money is good? The money is not going to tell you; it must be the faculty that makes use of such impressions – reason. Reason, in addition, takes the measure of music, grammar and the other arts, judging their benefit and deciding when it’s best to use them.
