# Personal Policy on Artificial Intelligence / Machine- and Deep-Learning

Machine- and deep-learning techniques with one exception are a great benefit to
humanity. The one exception is the unregulated, ignorant, and inhumane use of
generative AI.

I personally do not use generative AI to directly compose my work, be it code or
text.

- I believe the use of generative AI is good for quick answers, but its repeated
  use removes the barriers a student needs to overcome in order to truly
  understand a concept[^1] [^2]
- I dislike the abuse of the work made by hard-working humans, the
  degradation of their worth, and their displacement
- I take pride in my abilities as admin, developer, student, and technical
  writer. If ordered by my paid profession to use gen AI for its goals, I will
  do so (and probably be amazed, let's be honest). However, this repository is
  my project and I am not under any sponsorship or orders.

## Policy on the Use of this Library in AI Development

!!! info "The Use of this Library in AI Development is Welcome"
    The use of this library to develop AI techniques and models is welcome,
    _including the development of generative AI techniques for education_. The
    author wishes that its use to train generative AI models should have as its
    goal the assistance of humans rather than their displacement.

## Automation and AI

Lest someone accuse me of hypocrisy (I specialise in automation) or being a
Luddite (definitely not), note that I consider automation a different beast than
generative AI. Whereas automation handles repeated and error-prone tasks in
favour of letting people use their time creatively -- i.e., as humans -- the
abuse of generative AI removes the creativity. It also displaces the humans who
created the sources of its training.
